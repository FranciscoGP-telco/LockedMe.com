<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is created for the Java FSD Full Stack, phase 1, a course thaug by the academy [simplilearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/). In this phase we cover a overview of the Java language, and we need to create this application with the following requirments:

1. Show application name and the developer details 
2. The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information 
3. Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed:
  - The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it
  - The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:
    - Add a file to the existing directory list
    - Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list
    - Search a user specified file from the main directory
    - Option to navigate back to the main context
  - A third option to close the application

This project must implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
